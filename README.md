Camera to Video
#

Hey, and welcome to camera to video the library that will turn your photos from the camera, into a video.
This 

To install this locally run :
```
pip install c:\\path\to\here
```

After installing you will have the script `ctv`, which you can run with a path to a config file. You have the full example of a config file in this repository, in the `config.toml` file.

All the parameters in the script should be clear, and some of them have comments for better explanation. For more info about the toml file, search in google. but it is quite readable.

Example for running locally from this folder:
```
ctv config.toml
```

Enjoy!
